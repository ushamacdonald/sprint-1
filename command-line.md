Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?
The command line is basically just a way to talk to your computer. You get it to do stuff for you by giving it commands. It can be a lot quicker to do things this way than having to use your mouse and click through menus and buttons and so on.

List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.
cd [directory] - takes you to that directory
cd .. - goes back one directory
ls - lists content of directory
mkdir [name] - creates a new directory
touch [file name] - creates new file
rm [file name] - removes file
su - logs in as super user
exit - exits terminal
ctrl + c - kills current process
(up arrow) - scrolls up previous commands
